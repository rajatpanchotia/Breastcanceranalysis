# Breast Cancer Analysis
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, second only to lung  cancer.

The leading risk factor for breast cancer is simply being a woman. Though breast cancer does  occur in men, the disease is 100 times more common in women.

Men can also get breast cancer. In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimates 2,470 new  cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in men in the U.S.
A woman has about a one in eight chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer in her
lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Most women (about eight out of 10) who get breast cancer do not have a family history of the  disease.

	But women who have close blood relatives with breast cancer have a higher risk. Having a  first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter) with breast cancer almost doubles a womanâ€™s  risk.
